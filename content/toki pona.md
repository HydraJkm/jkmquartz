#conlangs
toki pona is a conlang that has only 120 words! Technically that's a rather low approximation, I prefer saying 141, seeing as that also includes some non pu words that many people use. It was created by Sonja Lang in some previous year, and has around 17,000 speakers at least (estimate pulled from the ma pona discord server). I am at least somewhat decent at it, and it's almost guaranteed for you to see it propagate within this psuedo-website. Even in its name. Whilst I named the vault `A whole new world (ma sin)`, the title you'll see is just `Hydrajkm's ma sin`. In toki pona, ma sin means new world. toki pona doesn't have capitalization, so all of those capitalization mistakes are actually intentional!
Here's a dictionary for it: [[lipu nimi pi toki pona]], but I prefer [nimi.li](https://nimi.li/), or [linku.la](https://linku.la/). They'll probably be more complete and have more features.
